We are a social, non-competitive Outdoors Club for adults (or a teen accompanied by an adult).  We participate in all kinds of outdoor activities. We schedule outdoor activities throughout the year, generally in the Erie, PA area and surrounding counties, including western NY and northeast Ohio.  \
  We mostly like to go hiking, bicycling, kayaking, camping, and backpacking; during the wintertime we hike, cross-country ski and snowshoe but are open to doing other activities as well.  We enjoy socializing and will sometimes get something to eat after an event.
