They are a social, non-competitive Outdoors Club for adults (or a teen accompanied by an adult).Â  We participate in all kinds of outdoor activities. We schedule outdoor activities throughout the year, generally in the Erie, PA area and surrounding counties, including western NY and northeast Ohio. They do mostly Cross-Country Skiing, Snow shoeing, hiking, bicycle riding, and backpacking and hiking.
